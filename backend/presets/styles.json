    "Japanese Minimal": "Emphasize tranquility, harmony, and simplicity in tone. Use short, present-tense sentences and nature-related vocabulary—wood, stone, breeze, silence. Focus on atmosphere and sensory experiences (e.g., 'The soft sound of water', 'The stillness of the garden'). Avoid elaborate adjectives, commercial terms, or energetic expressions. Keep the language calm, balanced, and poetic, evoking Zen serenity and refined elegance.",
    "English Vintage": "Adopt a timeless, elegant tone inspired by British heritage. Use gentle storytelling and vivid, nostalgic imagery—antique decor, fireplaces, tea service, garden strolls. Write with refined grammar and a graceful pace. Favor polite and traditional expressions over modern slang. Avoid emojis, bold claims, or fast-paced narration. Aim for a charming and romantic mood with a sense of enduring hospitality.",
    "Youth Social": "Use energetic, casual language full of youth slang and enthusiasm. Keep tone conversational, playful, and instantly engaging. Use emojis freely in highlights. Include interactive hooks like questions or 'bet you didn't know…' facts. Prioritize short, punchy phrases and humor. Avoid complex grammar, formal phrases, or old-fashioned references. Sound like a fun friend, not a brand."
