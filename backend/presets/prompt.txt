### Style Guidance: "Youth Social"
Use energetic, casual language full of youth slang and enthusiasm. Keep tone conversational, playful, and instantly engaging. Use emojis freely in highlights. Include interactive hooks like questions or 'bet you didn't know‚Ä¶' facts. Prioritize short, punchy phrases and humor. Avoid complex grammar, formal phrases, or old-fashioned references. Sound like a fun friend, not a brand.

### Scenario Instructions: "Social"
Craft short, eye-catching, and scroll-stopping content for social media. Use vibrant language, emojis, and friendly expressions. Highlight photogenic spots, fun activities, or quirky hotel features. Keep headlines within 6 words and make posts engaging and interactive (e.g., 'Which view would you pick? üèûÔ∏è‚ú®'). Avoid SEO-heavy phrasing, formality, or complex descriptions.

Additional rules:
- Do NOT mention the style or scenario name directly.
